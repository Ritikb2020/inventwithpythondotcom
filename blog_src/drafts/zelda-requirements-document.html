8-Bit NES Zelda Clone Requirements Document

I make project-based programming tutorials, often using video games for the project. They're a fun, engaging way to keep people motivated to learn how to code and the final product is fun to play with. These games are often simple to avoid making the code too hard to follow. When you're learning to code, it's much better to complete several small projects than only finish half of an enourmous one.

However, many folks would like to go to make an extended game. Something like Minecraft or Overwatch or Stardew Valley or some other game they love and have sunk a hundred hours into. It's a let down to realize that these games are beyond their skill level, and even if they weren't they would require months to create a rudimentary, unpolished version of them.

I've always thought that the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_(video_game)">8-bit NES Legend of Zelda</a> game would be a great candidate for a intermediate programming project: it incorporates elements of exploration, action, puzzles, and has a lot of clever design packed into a cartridge that only held 129kb of data.

I don't have time to develop a Zelda clone, but I thought what would help others is to organize a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_requirements_document">product requirements document</a> for anyone who would like to undertake this idea.

8-bit Zelda has several limitations that make it ideal for a beginner/intermediate level project:

<ul>
    <li>It's a 2D game that doesn't require a 3D engine or powerful gaming desktop.</li>
    <li>Each room is a single screen. There's no moving camera.</li>
    <li>The graphics are included in this document.</li>
    <li>The low resolution makes drawing new graphics simple.</li>
    <li>There's no need to write scripted dialogue.</li>
    <li>There's no physics system besides rectangle-based pass/block (not even gravity).</li>
    <li>The enemy AI tends to be simple.</li>
</ul>

8-bit "Zelda+" features (basically cribbed from Breath of the Wild):

<ul>
    <li>Weather and day/night cycle</li>
    <li>Cooking and crafting</li>
    <li>Quest and side quest system</li>
    <li>Destructible environments (chopping trees, etc.)</li>
    <li>Farming</li>
    <li>Player houses</li>
    <li>Stealth features</li>
    <li>Upgradable equipment</li>
    <li>Clothes and customizable looks</li>
</ul>

Advanced features:

<ul>
    <li>Rectangle based maps, rather than a strict grid.</li>
    <li>2D physics</li>
    <li>Multiplayer</li>
    <li>Camera</li>
</ul>

Meanwhile, we can also benefit from modern game design. TODO i know snes rpgs and link to the past and breath of the wild.

todo Of course, my biggest dream would be to create your own 8-bit NES Breath of the Wild

How to Read This Document

I've also organized this document into tiers, with each tier containing the features for a complete, playable game. The later tiers would be more feature rich, but the earlier tiers would be quicker to develop. This would prevent programmers from biting off more features than they could chew and ending up with a half-finished, unplayable project.

In general, the order of the features is a good order to implement them. Usually the earlier features are the foundation for the later features.

I don't specify a language or platform, just feature checklists. TODO but i use pygame & pyganim.
